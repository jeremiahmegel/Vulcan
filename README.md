Vulcan
======

When Google updated their Talk/Chat instant-messaging platform to "Hangouts" in May 2013, they added about 850 new emoticons, which many users disliked. For many of these emoticons, this Chrome extension removes their graphical representation and replaces them with time-tested text/ASCII versions that (ideally) convey the same emotion. This extension is also available on the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ccmlomkjlnhbjdjcgekbjgmmfkidnobh).
