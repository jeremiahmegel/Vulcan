				Hey there! My name is Jeremiah, and I'm the sole developer of
				Vulcan! I put a lot of work into making this extension, so I'd love
				it if you could show your appreciation! You don't need to give me any
				money (though I certainly wouldn't mind!), but if you have the time,
				go ahead and thank me!
				<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=JeremiahMegel&text=Thanks%20for%20Vulcan!"

					target="_blank">shoot me an e-mail</a>
				(vulcan@jeremiahm.com) to
				let me know that this extension is useful to you! If you do want to
				send a couple dollars my way, though,
